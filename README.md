# UniFit â€“ AI-Powered Personalized Fitness Tracker

---

## Project Description
UniFit is a full-stack web application that helps users achieve their fitness goals with **AI-generated personalized workout plans, flexible workout logging**, and **interactive progress visualization**. Users can track their routines, visualize improvements, and stay motivated with actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
Most fitness apps provide generic plans without considering **user goals or real-time progress**, making it hard to stay consistent. UniFit addresses this by **creating tailored AI-generated workout plans**, tracking workouts, and providing visual feedback to help users achieve their fitness goals efficiently.
